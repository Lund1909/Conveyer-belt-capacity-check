# Conveyer belt capacity check.
This program is designed to check the capacity of a conveyer belt, based on the user input of amount of motors and weight of packages. 
In this program the user writes input and receives output through the terminal.
The program also checks if the input from the user is valid based on the datatype. In case of an invalid datatype, it prints out a message to the user asking for them to try again with the correct data type. 
If the inputted datatypes is valid, it also prints an output of whether or not the conveyer belt can carry the packages based on the amount of motors. 
You will also find a flowchart giving a quick overview of the program.
